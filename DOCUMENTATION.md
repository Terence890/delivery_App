## 4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

### 4.1 HIGH LEVEL DESIGN (ARCHITECTURAL)
The Delivery App follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

*   **Mobile Frontend (Client):** Developed with React Native (Expo), providing native-like user interfaces for Customers, Delivery Agents, and Administrators. It communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests.
*   **Backend API (Server):** Built with FastAPI (Python), responsible for handling business logic, data persistence, authentication, and external service integrations (e.g., OSRM).
*   **Database:** MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, stores all application data.

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, allowing independent development and deployment of frontend and backend components.

### 4.2 LOW LEVEL DESIGN
The system is modularized into several key components:

*   **Authentication Module:** Handles user registration, login, token generation (JWT), and role-based access control.
*   **User Module:** Manages user profiles, roles, and delivery agent assignments.
*   **Product Module:** Provides CRUD operations for products, including image handling (base64) and category management.
*   **Cart Module:** Manages customer shopping carts, including adding, removing, and updating items.
*   **Order Module:** Processes order creation, status updates, and retrieval for different user roles. Includes stock management.
*   **Delivery Zone Module:** Allows administrators to define geographical delivery zones and assign agents.
*   **Routing Module:** Integrates with OSRM to provide optimized routes for delivery agents.
*   **Admin Statistics Module:** Gathers and presents key performance indicators for administrators.

Each module interacts with the MongoDB database through asynchronous operations and exposes well-defined API endpoints.

### 4.3 DATAFLOW DIAGRAM (Textual Description)
1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** Customer browses products, adds to cart, places order. Delivery Agent accepts order, updates status. Admin manages products, users, zones.
2.  **Frontend to Backend (HTTP Request):** Frontend sends API requests (e.g., `POST /products`, `GET /orders`) to the FastAPI backend.
